**Hi, I’m Ana Reyes (@miissymarley) 👋**

## About Me

👀 I’m passionate about: design, advertising, illustration, and digital experiences. I love creating visual solutions that are not only elegant but also meaningful and functional.

🌱 Currently exploring: the world of programming as I begin learning Python and JavaScript. My main focus is design (graphic, web, and UI/UX), but I’m expanding my skills to bring more interactivity and value to the projects I create.

💼 What I do: I run creative projects in graphic design, digital marketing, web design, and branding. I enjoy helping businesses and entrepreneurs build strong and visually appealing identities.

💞️ I’m open to collaborating on: projects related to design, branding, UI/UX, and creative marketing strategies. As I grow my programming knowledge, I’m also open to beginner-friendly collaborations in web development.
